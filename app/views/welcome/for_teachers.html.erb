			Imagine knowing what words are hard for your students. Most of all, imagine knowing
			which students struggle, and would benefit from your help.</p>

			<h1 class="blurb-header">Introducing the School Package</h1>
			<p>The school package is a special set of features designed for schools and school boards.
			It has all the same features that help students learn to spell on their own, plus features
			that get rid of the clerical work of teaching spelling, and let you focus on helping students
			learn to spell.
